# dqn-scratch
 
```dqn-scratch``` is an implementation of Deep Q-Learning from scratch with Python and PyTorch. The goal of this project is to provide a simple, well-documented implementation of DQN that is easy to understand and modify.

## Installation
```
conda create -n env_name
conda activate env_name
conda install pytorch::pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
conda install pygame
conda install gymnasium
```

## Requirements
- TODO

## Implementation Steps
1. Define the Q-Network class [DONE]
2. Define the Replay Buffer class [DONE]
3. Define the Agent class
4. Define the training loop
5. Training and evaluation
6. Define the main function
